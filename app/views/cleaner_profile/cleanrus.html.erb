      <p>I've been with Jaki since 2006 and love their service. I use them once a month and couldn't be any happier. I wish they offered weekends still, but I will change my schedule during the week just to keep them.</p>

      <p>Disappointed with the service - this time</p>
      <p>I have previously used your service 2 times and was pleased. This time it lacked quality and value. My appointment was for 1pm. A team of two arrived at 2:30pm, and a 3rd person arrived some time later. When they left at 6:30pm, my bathroom floors were dirty, areas of the hardwood floors had not been swept, and the staircase had areas not dusted. It was late when they left, and thus I did not ask them to redo anything. The service provided lacked quality and attention to detail.</p>

      <p>Disappointed with the service - this time</p>
      <p>They cleaned areas previous cleaning companies never touched. They are very efficient and usually thorough. The green cleaning is especially good due to allergies. I inspect prior to their leaving and very seldom are things overlooked on their part. If something is overlooked, I simply ask and they are more than accomodating to clean it. Overall, a great cleaning service. I have paid more and gotton less</p>

      <p>Not wowed</p>
      <p>To be honest I was not wowed and my expectations were barely met. While some areas were super clean like my steps, other areas were potentially not cleaned at all. I had cobwebs between my TV stand and the fire place, and the floor in my kitchen, cabinets and fridge were still really dirty. If I had paid half of what I paid, this would be fine, but at the price point I expected more.</p>

      <p>Great Job!</p>
      <p>We have two dogs that shed big time. The women who came to our house were great. They were very nice with a great attitude. They did a good job of tackling all of the fur that seems to still be on the floor after I sweep. They cleaned things that I didn't notice before so that when I came into the room it looked brand new. And the ceiling fan! I don't know what to say... Thank you.</p>
